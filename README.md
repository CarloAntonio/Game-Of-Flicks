## Udacity Android Nanodegree Project 1 & 2: Build it Bigger (Popular Movies)
This is a fully functional and colorful android application that I made for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program. The app displays a grid of posters based on the user's search preferences. The application supports searchs based on popularity and rating. The user can also display a list of previously saved movie titles. Details of the movies can be explored by clicking on the poster thumbnail.

### Features:
This app can:
* Display a grid of movie posters based on popularity or rating
* Save favorite movies and later display them as a grid
* Allow users to watch movie trailers
* Allow users to read movie reviews

### How to work with the source code:
This application uses [The Movie Database, TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API to serve the movie data. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. After obtaining an API key, add to the "API_KEY" constant in the MainActivity.java file.
